        Describe how to show a set
        <m>\mathbb{S}</m> spans a linear space <m>\mathbb{L}</m>.
        Describe 3 ways to show a set
        <m>\mathbb{S}</m> is linearly independent.

        Show <m>\{ \oq{1}{1}{0}{0},\oq{0}{1}{1}{0},\oq{0}{0}{1}{1} \}</m> is linear independent in <m>\mathbb{R}^4</m>.

        Given that <m>\mathbb{S} = \{ \ot{1}{0}{0},\ot{0}{1}{0} \}</m> is linearly independent in <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>,
        find a point <m>\mathbf{P}</m> such that
        <m>\mathbb{S} \cup \{\mathbf{P}\}</m> is also linearly independent.
        Describe all possible such points.

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>\mathbb{S}</m> is a linearly independent subset of <m>\mathbb{L}</m> and
        <m>\mathbf{P}</m> is a point of <m>\mathbb{L}</m>,
        not in <m>span(\mathbb{S})</m>,
        then <m>\mathbb{S} \cup \{ \mathbf{P} \}</m> is also linearly independent.
      </p>
    </statement>

      For this theorem students can use any of the three equivalent criteria for linear independence.
      You may have to point out that just not being able to write the new point as a linear combination of the old points is not good enough,
      they would also have to show that no old point can be written as a linear combination of union of the new point and the other old points.

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A finite subset <m>\mathbb{B}</m> of a linear space
        <m>\mathbb{L}</m> is a <term>basis</term>
        if each point in <m>\mathbb{L}</m> can be written in one and only one way as a linear combination of elements of <m>\mathbb{B}</m>.
        In other words,
        <m>\mathbb{B}</m> is a basis for <m>\mathbb{L}</m> if it spans
        <m>\mathbb{L}</m> and is linearly independent.
      </p>

    <term>Discussion Question 15.</term>
    For infinite subsets <m>\mathbb{B}</m> of <m>\mathbb{L}</m> define
    <m>span(\mathbb{B})</m> to be the set of all linear combinations involving a finite number of element of <m>\mathbb{B}</m>.
    With this addition the definitions of span and linearly independent can be extended to infinite subsets of <m>\mathbb{L}</m>.
    Thus a basis may contain an infinite number of elements;
    however, only a finite number of them may be used when making linear combinations.
    What problems could occur if infinite sums were allowed for linear combinations?
