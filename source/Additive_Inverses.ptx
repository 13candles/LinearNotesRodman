  <title>Additive Inverses</title>
  <p>
    The notes have been focusing on <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>,
    but what about <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>,
    can the same things be done there? or <m>\mathbb{R}^5</m>?
    What about any collection that behaves like
    <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m> in that elements can be added together and multiplied by real numbers?
    Examples of such are <m>2\times2</m> matrices and polynomials.
    It is a powerful tool to have a small set of elements that,
    by making linear combinations,
    can be used to represent the entire collection.
    This chapter generalizes the important ideas from Chapter 1.

        A <term>linear space</term> is a set
        <m>\mathbb{L}</m> containing objects called points where for any points
        <m>\mathbf{P}</m> and <m>\mathbf{Q}</m> in
        <m>\mathbb{L}</m> and any real number <m>t</m> there exist unique points:
        <ol>
          <m>\bullet</m> \= \mathbf{P} + \mathbf{Q} \= called the sum of <m>\mathbf{P}</m> and \mathbf{Q} <m>\bullet</m> \> <m>t</m>\mathbf{P} \> called the scalar product of <m>t</m> and \mathbf{P}
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        and where the following axioms are satisfied for any points
        <m>\mathbf{P}</m>, \mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{R}
        <m>\in \mathbb{L}</m> and any <m>a, b \in \mathbb{R}</m>:

    From this definition,
    the goal is to discover as many consequences as possible.
    This often involves working with equations.
    When working with equations one side of an equation may be changed if the other is changed in exactly the same way.
    Also, an object may be substituted with another to which it is equal.

        For <m>\mathbf{Q}</m> in linear space <m>\mathbb{L}</m>,

        Does it follow that <m>c\mathbf{0} = \mathbf{0}</m>?
        Is there a property that says <m>1\mathbf{Q} = \mathbf{Q}</m>?

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For any point <m>\mathbf{Q}</m> in linear space <m>\mathbb{L}</m>,
        there exists a point <m>\mathbf{X}</m> such that <m>\mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{X} = \mathbf{0}</m>.
        In addition, for any given
        <m>\mathbf{Q}</m> this point is unique.

      Remind the students that they have proved this before in the special case
      <m>\mathbb{L} = \mathbb{R}^3</m> but that now they must use the definition of linear space and not assume points are triples of real numbers.
      Once students decide to use the point -1\mathbf{Q} they are tempted to assume it satisfies the desired condition, \mathbf{Q} + -1\mathbf{Q} = <m>\mathbf{0}</m>,
      and show something true, \mathbf{0} = <m>\mathbf{0}</m>,
      follows from that assumption.
      I show them that I can "prove" <m>3 = 7</m> the same way:
      <m>3 = 7 \Rightarrow 0\times 3 = 0\times 7 \Rightarrow 0=0</m>.
      A good alternative is to name the point \mathbf{Q} + -1\mathbf{Q} =
      <m>\mathbf{Z}</m> and show \mathbf{Z} = 0.
      Telling them they should expect to use all of the axioms helps them look for which axioms apply instead of trying to work intuitively.

        Let \mathbf{Q} <m>\in \mathbb{L}</m>.
        The <term>additive inverse</term>
        of the point <m>\mathbf{Q}</m> is the point,
        written <m>-\mathbf{Q}</m>,
        that when added to <m>\mathbf{Q}</m> results in the additive identity element,
        <m>\mathbf{0}\in \mathbb{L}</m>.
        In symbols: <m>-\mathbf{Q}</m> is the point such that <m>\mathbf{Q} + -\mathbf{Q} = \mathbf{0}</m>.
      </p>

  <p>
    The symbol "<m>-</m>" is now used to indicate the additive inverse of a real number and the additive inverse of a point which makes <m>-1\mathbf{Q}</m> ambiguous.
    How can parenthesis be used to clarify which meaning of "<m>-</m>" is intended?
