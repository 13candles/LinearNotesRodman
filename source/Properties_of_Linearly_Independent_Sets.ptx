      <p>
        Is there an infinite subset in C[0,1] which is linearly independent?
        To demonstrate such a set one option is to use pictures and establish a pattern.

        Describe how to extend a linearly independent set to get a basis.
        Will this always work?

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>\mathbb{L}</m> has a basis
        <m>\mathbb{B} = \{ \mathbf{P}_1, \mathbf{P}_2,\ldots,\mathbf{P}_n \}</m> with a finite number of points,
        then the following hold:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              uad \= No linearly independent set contains more than <m>n</m> points.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Every linearly independent set with <m>n</m> points is a basis.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Every linearly independent set is contained in a basis.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

      Here the hard work of the previous theorems pay off.
