<p> I would like to thank David Farmer for helping me convert my Latex code 
		to a workable PreTeXt document in order to make the text freely available online, 
		both as a webpage and as a printable document. I also thank Alex Jordon for his support 
		through the PreTeXt support group and my colleague Dr. Forrest Stonedahl helping me learn to use Linux and GetHub.
