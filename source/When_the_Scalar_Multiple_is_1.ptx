        What is the notation for the additive inverse of <m>-\mathbf{Q}</m>?
        Find a vector other than <m>\mathbf{Q}</m> which satisfies the definition of additive inverse for<nbsp/><m>-\mathbf{Q}</m>.

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For any point <m>\mathbf{P}</m> in linear space <m>\mathbb{L}</m>:
        <me>
          1\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{P}
        </me>
      </p>

      This theorem can be proven in two very different ways.
      The more subtle way is hinted at in the excercises and relys on the uniquenss of the inverse of <m>-\mathbf{P}</m>.
      The other way uses that <m>\mathbf{P} +-1\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{0}</m> from theorem 6 and that <m>0\mathbf{P} =\mathbf{0}</m> from Axiom 4.
