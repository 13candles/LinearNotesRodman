      <p>
        An <term>ordered triple</term> of real numbers is written
        <m>\vect{v}=\ot{v_1}{v_2}{v_3}</m> where <m>v_1</m>, <m>v_2</m>,
        <m>v_3</m> <m>\in \mathbb{R}</m>.
        Such a triple can be interpreted geometrically as either a point:
        indicating a position in 3 dimensional space, or as a vector:
        visualized as an arrow indicating direction which can occur at any position.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless otherwise indicated, the Cartesian coordinate system,
        also known as the rectangular coordinate system, will be used.
        In this system the x,y and z axis are perpendicular and indicate the direction for the first,
        second and third coordinates respectively.

        As a <term>point</term> in the Cartesian coordinate system,
        <m>\vect{v} = \ot{v_1}{v_2}{v_3}</m>,
        is the position reached by beginning where the axes meet and moving a distance of <m>v_{1}</m> in the x direction,
        then <m>v_2</m> in the y direction followed by <m>v_3</m> in the z direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a <term>vector</term> in the Cartesian coordinate system,
        <m>\vect{v} = \ot{v_1}{v_2}{v_3}</m>,
        is visualized as an arrow which can start at any position and ends at the point obtained by moving a distance of <m>v_1</m> in the x direction,
        then <m>v_2</m> in the y direction followed by <m>v_{3}</m> in the z direction.

    Ordered triples can represent physical concepts such as position,
    velocity or force.
    They can also represent any triple of related data such as population of three related species:
    mice, smakes and hawks, or three related physical properties:
    temperature, pressure and volume.

    <statement>

        The set of all ordered triples is called
        <term>Euclidean space</term>
        or <term>real 3-space</term>,
        and written: <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>.
        Using set notation it is written:
        <me>
          \mathbb{R}^3=\{\ot{v_1}{v_2}{v_3} | v_1,v_2,v_3 \in \mathbb{R}\}
        </me>

        Let <m>\vect{v}=\ot{v_1}{v_2}{v_3} \in \mathbb{R}^3</m>.
        The <term>norm</term>, also called
        <term>length</term> or the <term>magnitude</term>
        and denoted <m>\|\vect{v}\|</m>,
        is the distance of the point from the origin when \mathbf{v} is interpreted as a position and the length of the arrow when \mathbf{v} is interpreted as a vector.

        For any right triangle with sides of length <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> and hypotenuse <m>c</m>:
        <me>
          a^2+b^2 = c^2

      When students work on proving the Pythagorean Theorem in class I tell them to use their knowledge of Geometry and give them one of three pictures to work with.
      From easiest to hardest, the picture hints I find work best are:
      <me>
        \begin{array}{ccc} <image width="20%" source="Pyth2"/>  \amp <image width="30%" source="Pyth1"/> \amp <image width="30%" source="Pyth3"/> \end{array}

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\vect{v}=\ot{v_1}{v_2}{v_3}</m> where <m>v_1</m>,
        <m>v_2</m>, and <m>v_3</m> are arbitrary real numbers.
        The norm of \mathbf{v} is given by the formula:
        <me>
          \|\vect{v}\|=

      Proofs are about justifying your claims.
      This is a good place to emphasise justifying each step.
      Some students will already know the distance formula and many will intuitively "know" the triangles formed by moving to the point \mathbf{v} are right triangles;
      encourage them to back up these claims by citing definitions and theorems from the text.
      Once a student gets the big idea,
      challenge them to consider cases where components are negative or zero.

    <em>Challenge 1.</em> In the case
    <m>\vect{v}=\ot{v_1}{v_2}{v_3}</m> is interpreted using spherical or cylindrical coordinates the norm of \mathbf{v} is given by the formula:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          pace \= <m>\|\vect{v}\|_{spherical} =</m>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>\|\vect{v}\|_{cylindrical} =</m>
        </p>
      </li>
