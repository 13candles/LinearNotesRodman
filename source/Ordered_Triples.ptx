      <p>
        An <term>ordered triple</term> of real numbers is written
        <m>\vect{v}=\ot{v_1}{v_2}{v_3}</m> where <m>v_1</m>, <m>v_2</m>,
        <m>v_3</m> <m>\in \mathbb{R}</m>.
        Such a triple can be interpreted geometrically as either a point:
        indicating a position in 3 dimensional space, or as a vector:
        visualized as an arrow indicating direction which can occur at any position.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless otherwise indicated, the Cartesian coordinate system,
        also known as the rectangular coordinate system, will be used.
        In this system the x,y and z axis are perpendicular and indicate the direction for the first,
        second and third coordinates respectively.

        As a <term>point</term> in the Cartesian coordinate system,
        <m>\vect{v} = \ot{v_1}{v_2}{v_3}</m>,
        is the position reached by beginning where the axes meet and moving a distance of <m>v_{1}</m> in the x direction,
        then <m>v_2</m> in the y direction followed by <m>v_3</m> in the z direction.

      <p>
        As a <term>vector</term> in the Cartesian coordinate system,
        <m>\vect{v} = \ot{v_1}{v_2}{v_3}</m>,
        is visualized as an arrow which can start at any position and ends at the point obtained by moving a distance of <m>v_1</m> in the x direction,
        then <m>v_2</m> in the y direction followed by <m>v_{3}</m> in the z direction.

    Ordered triples can represent physical concepts such as position,
    velocity or force.
    They can also represent any triple of related data such as population of three related species:
    mice, snakes and hawks, or three related physical properties:
    temperature, pressure and volume.

        The set of all ordered triples is called
        <term>Euclidean 3-space</term>
        and written: <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>.
        Using set notation it is written:
        <me>
          \mathbb{R}^3=\{\ot{v_1}{v_2}{v_3} | v_1,v_2,v_3 \in \mathbb{R}\}

        Let <m>\vect{v}=\ot{v_1}{v_2}{v_3} \in \mathbb{R}^3</m>.
        The <term>norm</term>, also called
        <term>length</term> or <term>magnitude</term>
        and denoted <m>\|\vect{v}\|</m>,
        is the distance of the point from the origin when <m>\vect{v}</m> is interpreted as a position, or the length of the arrow when <m>\vect{v}</m> is interpreted as a vector.

        For any right triangle with sides of length <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> and hypotenuse <m>c</m>:
        <me>
          a^2+b^2 = c^2

		To prove this consider dropping a perpendicular from the vertex containing the right angle to the hypotenuse and using similar triangles.
