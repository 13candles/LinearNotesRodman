    To define a specific Linear Space a set of points must be given and the actions of sum and scalar product described for these points.

        Does the set <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m> with operations as defined in Chapter 1 satisfy all the conditions to be a linear space?

        The <term>set of all continuous functions defined on the interval [0,1]</term>
        is denoted: C[0,1]. Given functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>,
        and real number <m>c</m>,
        define the functions <m>f+g</m> and <m>cf</m> by what they do to a given real number <m>x</m>,
        in this case:
        <m>(f+g)(x):=f(x) +g(x)</m> and <m>(cf)(x) := c \cdot f(x)</m>.
        Recall, a function <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>x</m> if <m>\lim_{w \rightarrow x} f(w) = f(x)</m>.

        For the graphs of continuous functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> given below,
        sketch graphs of the functions <m>f+g</m> and <m>3g</m>.
        Are these functions continuous on [0,1]? Will the sum of continuous functions always be continuous?
        Will a scalar multiple of a continuous function always be continuous?
        A good justification will use the definition of continuous.

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For any points <m>\mathbf{P}</m> and
        <m>\mathbf{Q}</m> in linear space <m>\mathbb{L}</m>,
        there is a unique point <m>\mathbf{Y}</m> such that <m>\mathbf{P}+\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{Q}</m>.

      Again, remind the students that they have proved this before in the special case
      <m>\mathbb{L} = \mathbb{R}^3</m> but that now they must use the definition of linear space and not assume points are triples of real numbers.
      Students who struggled with the last proof often gain confidence after proving this one.

    <statement>

        Let <m>\mathbf{P}</m> and <m>\mathbf{Q}</m> be points in linear space <m>\mathbb{L}</m>.
        The <term>difference of <m>\mathbf{Q}</m> from \mathbf{P}</term> is the point,
        written <m>\mathbf{Q}-\mathbf{P}</m>,
        that when added to <m>\mathbf{P}</m> results in <m>\mathbf{Q}</m>.
        In symbols: <m>\mathbf{Q}-\mathbf{P}</m> is the vector such that <m>\mathbf{P} + (\mathbf{Q}-\mathbf{P}) = \mathbf{Q}</m>.
