    To define a specific Linear Space a set of points must be given and the actions of sum and scalar product described for these points.

        Does the set <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m> with operations as defined in <xref ref="Euclidean_Spaces"/> on Euclidean Spaces satisfy all the conditions to be a linear space?

        The <term>set of all continuous functions defined on the interval [0,1]</term>
        is denoted: C[0,1]. Given functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>,
        and real number <m>c</m>,
        define the functions <m>f+g</m> and <m>cf</m> by what they do to a given real number <m>x</m>,
        in this case:
        <m>(f+g)(x):=f(x) +g(x)</m> and <m>(cf)(x) := c \cdot f(x)</m>.
        Recall, a function <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>x</m> if <m>\lim_{w \rightarrow x} f(w) = f(x)</m>.

        For the graphs of continuous functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> given below,
        sketch graphs of the functions <m>f+g</m> and <m>3g</m>.
        Are these functions continuous on [0,1]? Will the sum of continuous functions always be continuous?
        Will a scalar multiple of a continuous function always be continuous?
        A good justification will use the definition of continuous.
