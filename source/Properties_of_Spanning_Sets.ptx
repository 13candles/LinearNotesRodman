        Describe how to reduce a spanning set to get a basis.
        Will this always work?

    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>\mathbb{L}</m> has a basis
        <m>\mathbb{B} = \{ \mathbf{P}_1, \mathbf{P}_2,\ldots,\mathbf{P}_n \}</m> with a finite number of points,
        then the following hold:
        <ol>
          <li>

              No spanning set contains fewer than <m>n</m> points.

  <p>
    <xref ref="thm_lin_ind_prop"/> and <xref ref="thm_spanning_prop"/> together give the result that if a linear space has a basis with <m>n</m> points,
    then every basis must have <m>n</m> points.
    This observation leads to the following important definition.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If a linear space <m>\mathbb{L}</m> has a basis with <m>n</m> elements then <m>\mathbb{L}</m> is called an
        <term>n dimensional linear space</term>.
        If there is no finite set that forms a basis for <m>\mathbb{L}</m>,
        <m>\mathbb{L}</m> is said to be an 
        <term>infinite dimensional linear space</term>.
