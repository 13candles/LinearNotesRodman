     Finding the coefficients needed to describe a given point as a linear combination of other points often requires solving serveral linear equations
	 simultaneously. 
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>linear equation</term> is an equation of the form:
        <me>
          a_1 x + a_2 y + a_3 z=b
        </me>
        where the <m>a_i</m> represent specific real numbers called <term>constants</term>,
        <m>b</m> is also a real number and <m>x</m>,
        <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> are <term>variables</term>
        or <term>unknowns</term>.
        The <term>solution</term> to a linear equation is the set of ordered triples of real numbers, <m>\ot{x}{y}{z}</m> for which the equation is true.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    It is often important to be able to find solutions that work for multiple linear equations.
    To solve such a system of linear equations,
    transform it into simpler and simpler systems whose solutions are identical to the given system.
    Then use the simplified system to describe the values of <m>x</m>,
    <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> that make all equations in the system true,
    and give the result using set notation:
    <m>\mathbb{S}= \{\ot{\hspace{.1in}}{\hspace{.1in}}{\hspace{.1in}} | \hspace{.5in} \}</m>.
    This set may be empty,
    contain one ordered triple or more than one ordered triple.
  </p>

    <statement>
      <p>
        The three ways that can be used to transform a system of equations into a new system with exactly the same solutions are called
        <term>elementary row operations</term>.
        They are:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              rearrange the order of the rows
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              multiply a row by a non-zero number
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              add a multiple of one row to another
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    When working with systems of equations it is more efficient to write only the constants,
    making sure to keep them in columns so their variables can be reattached once the matrix is fully simplified.
    The result is called an augmented matrix.
    <me>
      \begin{array}{lcr} \left[ \begin{array}{ccccccc} a_{11}x \amp  + \amp  a_{12}y \amp  + \amp  a_{13}z \amp  = \amp  b_{1} \\ a_{21}x \amp  + \amp  a_{22}y \amp  + \amp  a_{23}z \amp  = \amp  b_{2} \\ a_{31}x \amp  + \amp  a_{32}y \amp  + \amp  a_{33}z \amp  = \amp  b_{3} \end{array}  \right] \amp  or \amp \left[ \begin{array}{ccccc} a_{11} \amp   a_{12} \amp   a_{13} \amp  : \amp  b_{1} \\ a_{21} \amp   a_{22} \amp   a_{23} \amp  : \amp  b_{2}  \\ a_{31} \amp   a_{32} \amp   a_{33} \amp  : \amp  b_{3} \end{array}   \right] \end{array}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    The elementary row operations apply to either the system of equations or the associated matrix.
    Ideally, but not always, the most simplified version looks like:
    <me>
      \begin{array}{lcr} \left[ \begin{array}{ccccccc} x \amp   \amp     \amp   \amp    \amp  = \amp  s_{1} \\ \amp   \amp   y \amp   \amp    \amp  = \amp  s_{2} \\ \amp   \amp     \amp   \amp  z \amp  = \amp  s_{3} \end{array}  \right] \amp  or \amp \left[ \begin{array}{ccccc} 1 \amp   0 \amp   0 \amp  : \amp  s_{1} \\ 0 \amp   1 \amp   0 \amp  : \amp  s_{2}  \\ 0 \amp   0 \amp   1 \amp  : \amp  s_{3} \end{array}   \right] \end{array}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    The solution in this case is a set with one ordered triple:
    <me>
      \mathbb{S} = \{ \ot{x}{y}{z}|\    x =s_1,y=s_2,z=s_3 \} = \{ \ot{s_1}{s_2}{s_3} \}
    </me>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        There exists a way to transform any system of linear equations in three unknowns into a well defined simplest form using only the three elementary row operations.
        This simplest form will allow any conditions on the three unknowns to be quickly identified.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Write an algorithm for simplifying any given system of equations in three unknowns.
        Describe how to identify when it is completely simplified and how to then identify the solution.
        Use the term
        <q>leading 1</q>
        for when 1 is the first non-zero number in a row.)

  <question>
    <p>
      Why are only the elementary row operations allowed when solving a system of equations?
      As a system of equations is simplified: What produces the possibility for no solutions?
      What produces the possibility for an infinite number of solutions?
      What might a fully reduced matrix look like in each case?
      Consider systems of two, three or four equations.
