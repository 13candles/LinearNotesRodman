    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\mathbb{S}</m> be a subset of a linear space
        <m>\mathbb{L}</m> containing more than one point.
        <m>\mathbb{S}</m> is linearly dependent if and only if some point of

  <question>
  <p>
    The definition of linear independence (<xref ref="def_lin_ind"/>), <xref ref="equivalent_to_lin_ind"/>,
    and <xref ref="lin_dep_means_lin_comb"/> give three equivalent criteria for a set to be linearly independent.
    Which matches the meaning of
    <q>independent</q>
    most closely?
    Which seems easiest to use to prove a set is linearly independent?
    Which makes the most sense paired with the definition of span?
    What do traditional Linear Algebra texts have for the definition of linearly independent?
