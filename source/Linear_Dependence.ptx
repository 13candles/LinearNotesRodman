        Use Theorem 12 to write another condition for
        <m>\mathbb{S}</m> to be linearly dependent.

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\mathbb{S}</m> be a subset of a linear space
        <m>\mathbb{L}</m> containing more than one point.
        <m>\mathbb{S}</m> is linearly dependent if and only if some point of
        <m>\mathbb{S}</m> is a linear combination of the other points of <m>\mathbb{S}</m>.

      I often arrange for weakers students to be in the same group for this theorem since here they can demonstrate mastery of proving
      <q>if and only if</q>
      statements and the definition of linearly dependent.

    <term>Discussion Question 14.</term>
    The definition, Theorem 12,
    and Theorem 14 give three equivalent criteria for a set to be linearly independent.
    Which matches the meaning of
    <q>independent</q>
    most closely?
    Which seems easiest to use to prove set is linearly independent?
    Which makes the most sense paired with the definition of span?
    What do traditional Linear Algebra texts have for the definition of linearly independent?
