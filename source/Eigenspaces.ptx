        when there exists a non-zero vector \mathbf{v} such that
        <m>\mtx{A}\vect{v} = \lambda \vect{v}</m> for some real number <m>\lambda</m> that vector is called an <term>eigenvector</term>

    <term>Example.</term> The effect of multiplication by a matrix on a representative set of vectors is illustrated below.
    Shown is a set of vectors and then those same vectors with the result of multiplying each of them by <m>\mtx{A} = \left[ \begin{array}{rr} 3 \amp  0 \\ 8 \amp  -1 \end{array}  \right]</m>.
    The vectors ({0},{1}) and ({1},{2}) are eigenvectors.
    Any scalar multiple of these vectors is also an eigenvector.
    The eigenvalue corresponding to ({0},{1}) is
    <m>\lambda= -1</m> and the eigenvalue corresponding to ({1},{2}) is <m>\lambda = 3</m>.

      <p>
        For any <m>n \times n</m> matrix <c>A</c>,
        the set of eigenvectors corresponding to a given eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m> becomes a subspace of
        <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m> if you include <m>\mathbf{0}</m>.

      Given matrix <c>A</c> has eigenvector \mathbf{v} with eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m> and <m>k~\in~\mathbb{R}</m>. What can you say about the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the matrix <m>k\mtx{A}</m>? What can you say about the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the matrix <m>\mtx{A}^k</m>? Does it matter what <m>k</m> is?
