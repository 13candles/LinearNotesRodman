		 A <term>line</term> extends coninuously and infinitely in one direction and the exact opposite of that direction. 
		 This means points lie on that line at every distance in that direction or its opposite from any point on that line.

		A <term>plane</term> extends continuously and infinitely in any combination of two directions, including the exact 
		opposite of those two directions. This means points lie on that plane at every combination of those directions from any point on the plane.
