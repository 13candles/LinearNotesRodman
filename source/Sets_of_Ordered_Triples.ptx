        Describe the set of points on the line in
        <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m> that passes through points
        <m>\vect{v} = \ot{1}{2}{3}</m> and $\mathbf{w} = \ot{2}{0}{-2}.

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For any two points \mathbf{v} and \mathbf{w} such that
        <m>\vect{v}\neq \vect{w}</m> there exists a set of points describing a line passing through both \mathbf{v} and \mathbf{w}.

      Here the goal is to show existence by defining a set using set notation and showing it contains points \mathbf{v} and \mathbf{w} and all points that lie in the same specific direction from a point that is in the set.
      This can be done using double set containment and follows from the definition of scalar multiplication.
      Similar triangles can be used to see that multiplication by a scalar does not change a vectors direction.

    <em>Challenge 3.</em> For any three points $\mathbf{v}<m>,\vect{w} and</m>\mathbf{u}<m>,such that</m>\mathbf{v} \neq \mathbf{w}<m>,
    and \vect{u} is not on the line through \vect{v} and</m>\mathbf{w}<m>,there exists a set of points describing a plane which passes through points</m>\mathbf{v}$,\mathbf{w} and \mathbf{u}.
