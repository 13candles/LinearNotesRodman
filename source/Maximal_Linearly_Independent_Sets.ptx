  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        <m>\mathbb{S}</m> is a basis for
        <m>\mathbb{L}</m> if and only if it is a maximal linearly independent subset of <m>\mathbb{L}</m>.
        In other words,
        <m>\mathbb{S}</m> is a basis for <m>\mathbb{L}</m> if and only if
        <m>\mathbb{S}</m> is linearly independent and not a proper subset of any other linearly independent set.
      </p>
    </statement>

      You may need to talk about the concept of maximal which is not the same as biggest.
