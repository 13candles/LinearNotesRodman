    <term>Discussion Question 20.</term>
    What problems might occur if the Dimension of a Vector Space were defined to be the number of elements in a basis?
    How is this similar to other situations where the term 'well defined' is used?

        Does Theorem 16 say there is no linearly independent set with more elements than a basis?
        Explain.

        Considering only finite subsets of <m>\mathbb{L}</m>,
        no linearly independent set has more points than a spanning set.

      This may be the hardest theorem in these notes.
      I usually give the hint that if one set is a subset of another set it can't have more points than that set.
      This proof should start with taking an arbitrary linearly independent set and an arbitrary spanning set.
      The replacement lemma can then be used to define a sequence of spanning sets that element by element take in every element of the linearly independent set.
      Pictures are helpful.
      For weaker students I suggest they start by assuming the linearly independent set has only three elements.
      Otherwise I suggest writing out at least three iterations and then generalizing.
