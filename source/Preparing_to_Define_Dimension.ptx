  <question>
  <p>
    What problems might occur if the dimension of a vector space were defined to be the number of elements in a basis?
    How is this similar to other situations where the term 'not well defined' is used?

    <statement>
      <p>
        Does <xref ref="thm_maximal"/> say there is no linearly independent set with more elements than a basis?
        Explain.

        Considering only finite subsets of <m>\mathbb{L}</m>,
        no linearly independent set has more points than a spanning set.
