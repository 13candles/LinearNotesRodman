  <title>When the Vectors are the Rows</title>
  <p>
    Until now our ordered n-tuples have appeared in matrices as columns.
    They can also be placed as rows.
    The following Theorem shows what can be learned by row-reducing such a matrix.

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Put the points of <m>\mathbb{S} = \{ \ot{3}{0}{-3}, \ot{1}{2}{3} \}</m> into a matrix as rows then row reduce the resulting matrix.
        Use <m>\mathbb{S}'</m> to denote the rows of the resulting matrix.
        What does Theorem 23 say about <m>span\mathbb{S}'</m>?

        set that spas the same space as the set spanned by <m>\mathbb{S} = \{ \ot{3}{0}{-3}, \ot{1}{2}{3},\ot{0}{1}{0} \}</m>.
        Is this new set linearly independent?

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\mathbb{S}</m> be a subset of a linear space <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m> and let
        <m>\mathbf{P}</m> be in <m>\mathbb{S}</m>.
        Assume that <m>\mathbf{Q}</m> is obtained from <m>\mathbf{P}</m> either by
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              uad \= multiplying <m>\mathbf{P}</m> by a non-zero number <term>or</term>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              adding to <m>\mathbf{P}</m> a scalar multiple of another element of <m>\mathbb{S}</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>\mathbb{S}'</m> be obtained from <m>\mathbb{S}</m> by replacing
        <m>\mathbf{P}</m> with <m>\mathbf{Q}</m>.
        Then <m>\mathbb{S}'</m> will span the same linear space as <m>\mathbb{S}</m>.
        In other words: <m>span\mathbb{S}' = span\mathbb{S}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition,
        if <m>\mathbb{S}''</m> consists of the non-zero rows of a fully simplified matrix,
        then <m>\mathbb{S}''</m> is linearly independent.
      </p>
    </statement>

      The first half of this theorem is another application of the Replacement Lemma.
      For the second half,
      that every nonzero row has a leading 1 in a position in which all the other rows will have zeros,
      is the key to showing the nonzero rows are linearly independent.
