  <title>To the Student</title>
  <p>
    The main goal of this course is to increase your ability to read and understand new mathematics,
    connect concepts to justify new statements,
    and express your reasoning clearly both orally and in writing.
    The problems and theorems in these notes carefully build on each other,
    increasing in content and difficulty.
    Notice this text is very short compared to most math texts,
    it is important that you read it carefully and repeatedly.
    It is essential that you struggle with each new idea in turn,
    finding your own solution and not seeking out existing solutions from other texts,
    on-line sources, or written work done by other students.
    Talking to other students is encouraged,
    but only seek out other students once you have made as much progress on the exercises and theorem for yourself as you can.
